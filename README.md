# Docker - The hard way

This tutorial covers [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a tool which provides a high-level interface for managing Linux containers in a convenient way. We will walk through its basic and advanced features, but also take our time to demystify the underlying technologies which make containers possible in the first place.    

This guide aims at undergraduate or graduate CS students which have little or no knowledge of Docker and/or container technology in general.


## Outline

 - [About Docker and container technology](docs/01-about.md)
 - [Installing Docker](docs/02-installing.md)
 - ["Hello Docker"](docs/03-hello-docker.md)
